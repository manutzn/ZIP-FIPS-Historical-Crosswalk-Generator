# ZIP-FIPS-Historical-Crosswalk-Generator (2010-2023)

This repository provides code for constructing a historical, quarterly dataset that systematically maps USPS ZIP codes to their corresponding FIPS codes. By utilizing data from the HUD USPS ZIP Code Crosswalk Files API, the code establishes a consistent and structured relationship between these geographical identifiers across different time periods. This tool is essential for precise spatial linkage in empirical research and policy analysis, enabling scholars and analysts to integrate and align datasets that employ varying geographical coding schemes over time. By ensuring accurate and reliable correspondence between ZIP codes and FIPS codes historically, it enhances the robustness and validity of analyses that depend on consistent geographical identifiers.

## Understanding the Generated Files

After running the `ZIP-FIPS-Historical-Crosswalk-Generator.R` script, two files will be generated:

- `quarterly_crosswalk_zip_county.csv`
- `quarterly_crosswalk_zip_county.rds`

These files contain the ZIP-FIPS crosswalk data with the following variables:

| **zipcode**   | 5-digit USPS ZIP code.                                                                                                                           |
| **fips_code** | 5-digit unique 2000 or 2010 Census county GEOID, consisting of state FIPS code plus county FIPS code.                                             |
| **res_ratio** | The ratio of residential addresses in the ZIP–County part to the total number of residential addresses in the entire ZIP.                         |
